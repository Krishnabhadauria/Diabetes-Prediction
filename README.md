# <span style="color:#2c3e50;">Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning</span>

## <span style="color:#16a085;">Overview</span>
This project aims to predict the onset of diabetes using machine learning algorithms applied to the `diabetes.csv` dataset from Kaggle. The project also includes data visualization to represent the outcomes and insights derived from the dataset. The analysis and implementation are performed using Jupyter Notebook (IPython).

## <span style="color:#16a085;">Dataset</span>
The dataset used in this project is `diabetes.csv`, sourced from Kaggle. It contains several medical predictor variables and one target variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

## <span style="color:#16a085;">Project Structure</span>
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks with the analysis, visualizations, and machine learning models.
- `diabetes.csv/`: Includes the `diabetes.csv` dataset.
- `diabetes prediction ppt/`: Stores images and plots generated during the data visualization process.
- `README.md`: This readme file.

## <span style="color:#16a085;">Installation</span>
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Krishnabhadauria/Diabetes-Prediction.git
    cd diabetes-prediction
    ```
2. Set up a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## <span style="color:#16a085;">Usage</span>
1. Download the `diabetes.csv` dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3. Open and run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data, visualize it, and apply machine learning models.

## <span style="color:#16a085;">Key Findings</span>
1. `data_exploration.ipynb`: Initial data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing.
2. `data_visualization.ipynb`: Visualization of dataset features and target variable.
3. `model_building.ipynb`: Building and evaluating various machine learning models.
4. `model_evaluation.ipynb`: Comparing model performance and selecting the best model.

## <span style="color:#16a085;">Results</span>
